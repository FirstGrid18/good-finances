# Good Finances — by FirstGrid

**Good Finances** is an AI-powered personal finance toolkit designed to help (mainly UK-based) users make clearer, calmer money decisions.

It combines:

- Printable and digital planners
- Simple calculators and checklists
- Accessibility-friendly layouts (dyslexia-aware design, clean fonts, high contrast)

This repo documents the product direction, not the underlying GPT prompt.
