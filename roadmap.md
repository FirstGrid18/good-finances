# Good Finances – Roadmap (High-Level)

This is a directional roadmap, not a commitment. It’s here to show how the product could evolve.

## Phase 1 – Foundation

- ✅ Define core user personas and main use cases.
- ✅ Create starter templates (budget, calendar, savings).
- ✅ Build first private version of the Good Finances AI assistant.
- ☐ Add basic guidance flows (e.g. “Help me set up my first budget”).

## Phase 2 – Guidance & Education

- ☐ Short, plain-language explainers on UK concepts (ISAs, pensions, tax bands).
- ☐ AI-powered “money health check” that reviews a simple snapshot from the user.
- ☐ Scenario-based prompts (e.g. “I want to save £X in 12 months”, “I want to invest”).
- ☐ Add more dyslexia-friendly and neurodivergent-friendly design options.

## Phase 3 – Deeper Planning

- ☐ Long-term planning templates (5–10 year money view).
- ☐ Retirement & investment planning helpers (non-advice, educational).
- ☐ Export options (PDF, CSV) and printable packs.
- ☐ Optional integrations or automations later (if needed).

The priority is always: **make decisions easier, not more complicated.**
